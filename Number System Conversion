Decimal means 10 
Our number systems contains 10 different digits - 0 to 9 
Also, each place value in a number is 10 raised to some power. 
Example 56 = 50 + 6 = 5 X 10^1 + 6 X 10^0 123 = 100 + 20 + 3 = 1 X 10^2 + 2 X 10^1 + 3 
Note: Any number raised to the power 0 is 1. 10^0 = 1
So, our number system is based on the system of 10s. 
But a number system can be based on any number. 
What if we use only 2 digits - 0 and 1.
and every place value is 2 raised to some power?
Our numbers will only contain 0 and 1.
What will 101 mean in such a number system?
This number system is known as Binary number system. 
One popular number system is called Hexadecimal number system.
Hexadecimal number system is based on 16 digits !!
Hex (6) + Dec (10)
We use alphabets to represent
numbers after 9.
A : 10
B: 11
C: 12
D: 13
E: 14
F: 15
From 0 to F, we have 16 digits which can be used to represent hexadecimal number system!!
What would the number AD mean in hexadecimal number system?
AD = A X 16^1 + D X 16^0
= 10 X 16 + 13 X 1
= 160 + 13
= 173
What would number FE mean in hexadecimal number system?
FE = 15 X 16 + 14
= 254
How would you write 255 in hexadecimal number system?
Divide 255 with 16
255 / 16 => Quotient 15 (F) and
remainder 15 (F)
So, the hexadecimal number is FF =
15 X 16 + 15
Each color - red, green and blue has 256 different shades ranging from 0 to 255.
When different shades of red, green and blue are combined, different colors are generated.
For computer programmers and color designers, it is faster to use hexadecimal numbers to represent colors.
We add '#' before a hexadecimal number to tell the computer that it is hexadecimal.
0 in hexadecimal is 00
