The HTML class attribute it's used to specify a class for an HTML element. Multiple HTML elements can share the same class. 
It is used to point to a class name in the style sheet.
The class attribute is used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". 
All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="city">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Tokyo</h2>
  <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

The <li> tag defines a list item. 
The <li> tag is used inside ordered lists(<ol>), unordered lists (<ul>). 
In <ul> , the list items will usually be displayed with bullet points. 
In <ol>, the list items will usually be displayed with numbers or letters.


The <h> tags (<h1>,<h2>,etc.) are meant for headings and sub-headings, 
not ordinary text as the <p> (paragraph) tag is. 
Header tags indicate that their contents are more important than normal,  
and are treated specially by Google's index, and by some text-to-speech browsers as well.

href is a referance to another HTML page, it is used to link one page to another.

The border can be solid, dotted, dashed, none, grooved, etc.
